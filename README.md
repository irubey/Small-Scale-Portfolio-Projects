Welcome to my Small-Scale Portfolio Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of my exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects and small-scale data scraping scripts. Each project is designed to showcase my skills in data analysis, data cleaning, and web scraping. Below is a brief description of each file and its purpose. 
Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any questions or feedback!

## EDA Projects

### EDA_covid_data.sql
This SQL script performs exploratory data analysis on COVID-19 data. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and various queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

### EDA_imdb_movie_data.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook analyzes IMDb movie data. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to understand trends and patterns in movie ratings, genres, and other attributes.

### EDA_sales_data.sql
This SQL script performs exploratory data analysis on sales data. It includes data cleaning, aggregation, and various queries to derive insights into sales performance over time, across regions, and product categories.

### EDA_temperature_data.sql
This SQL script conducts exploratory data analysis on temperature data. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and queries to analyze temperature trends, anomalies, and patterns over time.

## Web Scraping Projects

### amazon_product_data_scraper.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook contains a web scraper for Amazon product data. The script scrapes product details such as names, prices, ratings, and reviews, and saves the data for further analysis.

### plane_tickets_price_drop_notification.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook implements a web scraper and notifier for plane ticket prices. It monitors specified flight routes and sends notifications when prices drop below a certain threshold.

## Utility Scripts

### logbookToCSV.mjs
This script converts logbook data to CSV format. It is designed to parse and clean logbook entries, then export them as a CSV file for easier analysis and reporting.
